## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Note About Running the Application

The application **cannot** be run by simply opening the `index.html` file directly in a browser. This is due to:
- Browser security restrictions (CORS policy)
- ES6 module loading requirements
- Local file access limitations

Instead, you must use a local development server. Here are some options:

1. **Using VS Code (Recommended)**:
   - Install the "Live Server" extension
   - Right-click on `index.html`
   - Select "Open with Live Server"

2. **Using Python**:
   - Open terminal in project directory
   - Python 3: `python -m http.server 8080`
   - Visit `http://localhost:8080`

3. **Using Node.js**:
   - Install `http-server` globally: `npm install -g http-server`
   - Run: `http-server`
   - Visit the URL shown in terminal

## üîÑ Forking and Deploying Your Own Instance

You can create your own instance of Deep Site Editor by following these steps:

### 1. Fork the Repository

1. Visit the [Deep Site Editor repository](https://github.com/rolsite/deepsiteeditor)
2. Click the "Fork" button in the top-right corner
3. Select your account as the destination for the fork
4. Wait for GitHub to complete the forking process

### 2. Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your forked repository's settings
   - Click on "Settings" in the top menu
   - Select "Pages" from the left sidebar

2. Configure the Source
   - Under "Source", click the dropdown menu
   - Select "gh-pages" branch
   - Click "Save"

3. Wait for Deployment
   - GitHub will start deploying your site
   - This usually takes a few minutes
   - You'll see a message saying "Your site is published at..."

### 3. Access Your Instance

1. Your site will be available at:
   `https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/deepsiteeditor`

2. Configure Your Instance:
   - Open the site in your browser
   - Click the settings icon (‚öôÔ∏è)
   - Enter your OpenRouter API key
   - Customize other settings as needed

### 4. (Optional) Local Development

If you want to develop locally:

1. Clone your fork:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/deepsiteeditor.git
   cd deepsiteeditor
   ```

2. Set up development server (choose one):
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8080

   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server

   # Or use VS Code Live Server
   ```

3. Make your changes:
   - Edit files as needed
   - Test locally using your preferred server
   - Commit and push changes to GitHub
   - GitHub Pages will automatically update

### 5. Keeping Your Fork Updated

To sync with the original repository:

1. Add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/rolsite/deepsiteeditor.git
   ```

2. Fetch and merge updates:
   ```bash
   git fetch upstream
   git checkout main
   git merge upstream/main
   git push origin main
   ```

**Note**: Remember to never commit your API keys or sensitive information to the repository.

## üîí Known Issues and Solutions

### CORS Issues on GitHub Pages

When deploying to GitHub Pages, you might encounter CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) errors when trying to access the OpenRouter API. This happens because GitHub Pages enforces strict security policies. To fix this, you have several options:

1. **Use a CORS Proxy (Recommended for Testing)**
   - Update the API URL in the code to use a CORS proxy
   - Example using cors-anywhere:
     ```javascript
     const url = 'https://cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com/https://openrouter.ai/api/v1/chat/completions';
     ```
   - Note: For production, set up your own proxy server

2. **Set Up Your Own Backend (Recommended for Production)**
   - Create a simple backend service (Node.js, Python, etc.)
   - Route API requests through your backend
   - Deploy to platforms like:
     - Vercel
     - Netlify
     - Heroku
     - Azure Functions
     - AWS Lambda

3. **Configure OpenRouter Headers**
   - Make sure your request includes the correct headers:
     ```javascript
     headers: {
       'Content-Type': 'application/json',
       'Authorization': `Bearer ${apiKey}`,
       'HTTP-Referer': 'https://YOUR_USERNAME.github.io/deepsiteeditor',
       'X-Title': 'DeepSiteEditor'
     }
     ```

4. **Local Development**
   - When developing locally, use a development server (as described above)
   - Local development servers typically don't have CORS restrictions

### Security Considerations

- When using a CORS proxy, be cautious with sensitive data
- Never expose your API keys in client-side code
- Consider implementing token encryption
- Use environment variables for sensitive data when possible
